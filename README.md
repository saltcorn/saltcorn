# Saltcorn

Saltcorn is an extensible open source no-code database application builder. Use it to build web applications based on relational data with flexible views, datatypes and layouts.

This repository contains the core codebase, including the code necessary to self-host an instance and to host a multitenant instance.

## Trying out Saltcorn

A multitenant instance of Saltcorn is running at [saltcorn.com](https://saltcorn.com), and you can create a new application under a subdomain at [https://saltcorn.com/tenant/create](https://saltcorn.com/tenant/create).
This service is free but there are no guarantees about the security or availability of your application or the information you are storing. This service should only be used to explore the capabilities of saltcorn.

For self-hosting, a 1 GB virtual private server is sufficient to run Saltcorn unless you expect high traffic volumes. Installation instructions are given below. If hosting on DigitalOcean, which offers a 1GB virtual machine for $5 per month, please consider using my [referral code](https://m.do.co/c/a1bcfb757fda) which will give you $100 credit over 60 days.

## Acknowledgements

Saltcorn is using [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgres/postgres), [node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/), [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), [live-plugin-manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-plugin-manager), [craft.js](https://craft.js.org/), [jQuery-Menu-Editor](https://github.com/davicotico/jQuery-Menu-Editor), [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) and other awesome free and open source projects.

## Quickstart with Docker

You can run a local instance for quick testing by running the following command:

`cd ./deploy/examples/test && docker-compose up -d`

and then go to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

NOTE: The dependencies to build mobile apps are quite large, they are not installed in the standard docker image (saltcorn/saltcorn). To use an image that includes the mobile dependencies as well, either use 'saltcorn/saltcorn-with-mobile' directly or replace 'saltcorn/saltcorn' with 'saltcorn/saltcorn-with-mobile' in the docker-compose file.

## Quick install server on Debian/Ubuntu

This has been tested on Debian 9, 10 and 11 and Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and 22.04. All you need is to run these
three lines on the command line shell, as root or as a user with sudo access:

```
wget -qO - https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -qqy nodejs
npx saltcorn-install -y
```

The first two lines will install Node.js 16. The last line will call the Saltcorn install script
accepting all the defaults, which installs PostgreSQL and sets up Saltcorn as a service
listening on port 80.

If you want a different port, different database backend, or to not install as a service, you
can omit the final `-y` to get an interactive installation:

```
wget -qO - https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -qqy nodejs
npx saltcorn-install
```

## Install from NPM packages

Instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 on a 1GB VM.

TL;DR: `npm install -g @saltcorn/cli && saltcorn setup`

### Installing node and npm

For a recent version (v16) of Node.js:

```
wget -qO - https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs libpq-dev build-essential python-is-python3
```

### Install saltcorn

`npm install -g @saltcorn/cli`

If this fails, you may need to tell npm to disregard file permissions during compilation:

`npm install -g @saltcorn/cli --unsafe`

Sometimes, the above commands fail to install the library `sd-notify` (which is useful for
integrating with systemd) even though it is installable. You can rectify that by installing
it subsequently:

`npm install -g sd-notify`

### Setup (automated)

if you are `root`, create a user with sudo and switch to that user:

```
adduser saltcorn
adduser saltcorn sudo
su saltcorn
cd
mkdir -p ~/.config/
```

then run

`saltcorn setup` and follow the instructions given.

### Setup (manual)

NOTE: this is somewhat out of date; see instead https://wiki.saltcorn.com/view/ShowPage?title=Install%20on%20Ubuntu, in paticular the last section.

Skip this section if you ran `saltcorn setup` or `npx saltcorn-install`

1. Install PostgreSQL: `sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-client`
2. Either,

   - Create a JSON file `.saltcorn` in your XDG config directory (on Ubuntu this is normally \$HOME/.config) with these values:

     - `host`: address of PostgreSQL server
     - `port`: port of PostgreSQL server
     - `database`: PostgreSQL database
     - `user`: PostgreSQL user name
     - `password`: PostgreSQL user password
     - `session_secret`: Saltcorn session secret
     - `multi_tenant`: run as multi-tenant (true/false)

     For example:

     ```
     {
        "host":"localhost",
        "port":5432,
        "database":"saltcorn",
        "user":"tomn",
        "password":"dgg2342vfB",
        "session_secret":"hrh64b45b3",
        "multi_tenant":true
     }
     ```

     Or,

   - Set environment variables. `SALTCORN_SESSION_SECRET`, `SALTCORN_MULTI_TENANT` (defaults to `false`), and either `DATABASE_URL` or `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGPASSWORD`.

### Run

`saltcorn serve`

### Server install

#### Install saltcorn as a service

Installing saltcorn as a service will mean it runs in the background and restarts automatically if the system reboots.

create a file `/lib/systemd/system/saltcorn.service` with these contents:

```
[Unit]
Description=saltcorn
Documentation=https://saltcorn.com
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=notify
WatchdogSec=5
User=saltcorn
WorkingDirectory=/home/saltcorn
ExecStart=/home/saltcorn/.local/bin/saltcorn serve -p 80
Restart=always
Environment="NODE_ENV=production"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

run:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start saltcorn
sudo systemctl enable saltcorn
```

This may be in a different location in non-Debian systems, e.g. in `/etc/systemd/system` instead.

In order to allow the `saltcorn` user to open port 80, you need to permission node.js to allow
this by running:

```
sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' `which node`
```

#### SSL certificate

Use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) or [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/) to get a free SSL certificate (for https).

## Install from source (for saltcorn developers)

### Installing node and npm on Ubuntu

`sudo apt install nodejs npm libpq-dev`

will give you a usable version. For a more recent version (v16) of Node.js:

```
wget -qO - https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs libpq-dev
```

### Prepare Node

assuming you have cloned this repository to \$HOME/saltcorn (otherwise adjust PATH)

```
npm config set prefix ~/.local
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/saltcorn/packages/saltcorn-cli/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Install packages

run

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run tsc
```

to install everything. If successful, you should now be able to run `saltcorn` in your shell.

NOTE: the installation builds the 'saltcorn/cordova-builder' docker image, and the first build takes several minutes. You can set the environment variable SKIP_DOCKER_IMAGE_INSTALL to 'true' (or disable docker) if you don't want to build it.

## Packages

- [@saltcorn-cli](https://github.com/saltcorn/saltcorn/tree/master/packages/saltcorn-cli): command-line interface

## Development tips

### Prettier

we use prettier:

`npm install -g prettier`

to format code:

`git ls-files | grep -v builder_bundle | xargs prettier --write`

Run this before every pull request.

### dev server

`nodemon packages/saltcorn-cli/bin/saltcorn serve`

to also watch a local module

`nodemon --watch ../saltcorn-kanban/ packages/saltcorn-cli/bin/saltcorn serve`

### React build builder

```
cd packages/saltcorn-builder
npm install
npm install styled-components@4.4.1
npm run build
```

### React rebuild on save

in `saltcorn/packages/saltcorn-builder/` run:

`git ls-files | entr npm run builddev`

but this is not a production build, so run

`npm run build`

when done

### Build tsdocs

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run tsc
```

then

`npm run docs`

TSDocs will then be available in `docs/`.

To deploy these to https://saltcorn.github.io/tsdocs/:

```
cp -R docs/* /path/to/tsdocs
cd /path/to/tsdocs
git add .
git commit -am 'version number or other message...'
```
