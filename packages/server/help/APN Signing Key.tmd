To send push notifications via APNs, you need to create an **APNs Auth Key (.p8 file)** in your Apple Developer account.

Follow these steps:

### 1. Log in to the Apple Developer Portal
1. Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account
2. Sign in with your Apple Developer account.
3. Navigate to **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**.

### 2. Create a New Key
1. In the left menu, click **Keys**.
2. Click the **“+” (Add)** button to create a new key.
3. Enter a name for the key (e.g., `MyApp APNs Key`).
4. Enable **Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)**.
5. Click **Continue**.
6. Click **Register**.

### 3. Download the .p8 File
1. Click **Download** to download the key file.
2. The file will be downloaded as a `.p8` file.
3. Store this file in a secure location — it can only be downloaded once.

### 4. Configure the builder menu
1. Upload your **.p8** file to the **`/mobile-app-configurations`** directory.
2. Select the file in the **APN Signing Key (.p8 file)** input field.
3. In the Apple Developer Portal under **Keys**, copy the **APNs Key ID** and paste it into the corresponding input field.

⚠️ **Important:**  
The `.p8` file can only be downloaded once. If you lose it, you must revoke the key and create a new one.
