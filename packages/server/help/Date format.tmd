You can define how a state value should be shown by specifying a date format String
which supports a range of formatting options. The formatting is provided by the 
[Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) library with the 
[AdvancedFormat](https://day.js.org/docs/en/plugin/advanced-format) extension.
