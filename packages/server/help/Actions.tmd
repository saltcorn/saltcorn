The action chosen will determine what happens when the trigger occurs. 
After you have chosen an action, there will be further configuration of that action.

The available actions, some of which are only accessible when the trigger is 
table-related, are: 

{{# for (const [name, action] of Object.entries(scState.actions)) { }}
* `{{name}}`: {{action.description||""}}
{{# } }}
